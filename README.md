## Development Plans:

2. Convert Components to using local state instead of higher level state (context) when appropriate

4. Convert current sea of divs to semantically named HTML elements
5. Refactor CSS / Remove unused rulesets
6. Convert all CSS to preprocessor (Sass or SCSS)
7. Make appropriate commits for each feature that I work on
8. Update information in each section
