    "I like Matt's relaxed attitude; he makes it easy for students to open up about themselves, but he doesn't try to force that. It makes for a good learning environment.",
    "I like the way you explain and show how to do everything and the fact that you will look something up and find an answer for us when you dont have an answer",
    "Matt really shows concern for his students form the start. He didn't see my name on the Slack channel for our class. When I check my email, he had try three time (I couldnâ€™t check my email for two day)to reach me  to let me know about it and to help.",
    "I love how he answers everyone's questions in detail.",
    "Matt is very good at give suggestion, follows up with answers to students questions that he can not answer right way. Also today at the end of today class he invited to stay those that wanted to learn how to use VS cold short-cuts.",
    "I don't have complaints. He's approachable and willing to assist.",
    "Great attitude and  availability. Willing to learn with us.",
    "So far, so good.  Matt answers everyone's questions, and does everything he can to keep people engaged, without making things stressful.",
    "I appreciate how he goes out of his way to answer questions, even those regarding content not covered.",
    "So, I posted a question about JavaScript that was completely tangential to the lesson in our Slack channel this week.  Matt responded almost immediately, explained that JavaScript doesn't have a quick and easy way to do what I wanted to do, and then explained--clearly and in detail--how to make it happen by combining a handful of existing functions. This led to me creating a reusable function that I saved to a .js file, and can copy into future files whenever I need it.",
    "I absolutely loved that instead of just looking at slides he actually showed us what it all meant in Visual Studio Code. Helped me grasp everything a lot better! Only thing I wish we did was go back to each slide after every example had been explained. But he did explain all the content of the slides within VSC which was very important for my understanding.",
    "Very concise and to the point, coming from a fellow educator, he cares about what he's teaching. Great instruction so far!",
    "CSS has always been the challenge for me. I can program functionality and layout but the design aspect of CSS has always been weird. With the instruction I got, I don't need to use in-line styles anymore.",
    "I am learning so much. Its a lot of information but I am really thankful for Matt's patience",

    "Matt helped me tremendously with understanding/explaining the content.",
    "I appreciate the time you put into explaining the assignment/coursework on the workshop.  Don't worry about going over the hour and cutting into the alotted time for the assignment. We get so much more from you than the provided videos (not that they are bad). If we didn't value your teaching we could have just done youtube videos.  I really appreciate you going above and beyond providing more time with us than the allotted four hours.",
    "My instructor was very informative, knowledgeable, and was available and able to answer questions.",
    "My instructor is great. He works with us during the workshops and answers as many questions that we might have so we walk away with more than what the slides have. This is great for me, because he's made it easier to grasp some of the more difficult concepts.",

    "Matt Taylor is one of the best instructors I have ever had. he is very knowledgeable, approachable and up beat individual. His feedback was greatly appreciated and helped me realize the minor adjustments that were needed. I leave this bootcamp feeling like I am ready to next the next step to Full Stack. I just wish Matt was going to be my instructor there.",
